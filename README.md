## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in **full-stack web development**, especially using **React (Next.js)** on the frontend and **Go** on the backend. I enjoy building real-world applications, learning clean architecture, and deploying projects using modern tools like **Docker and CI/CD**.

Right now, I’m focused on:

🚀 Strengthening my React & TypeScript fundamentals  
🧠 Building scalable backend APIs with Go  
🐳 Learning DevOps basics (Docker, deployment, CI/CD)  
📚 Improving my technical communication in English  

My goal is to work remotely as a **Full-Stack Developer**, contribute to real products, and keep growing through hands-on experience.
