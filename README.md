## About Me
<!--
I’m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in **full-stack web development**, especially using **React (Next.js)** on the frontend and **Go** on the backend. I enjoy building real-world applications, learning clean architecture, and deploying projects using modern tools like **Docker and CI/CD**.
-->
I am an Informatics student focused on backend engineering and cloud-native systems.  
Currently, I am learning and building scalable backend services using **Go**, **Docker**, and modern deployment workflows.

<!--
Right now, I’m focused on:

🚀 Strengthening my React & TypeScript fundamentals  
🧠 Building scalable backend APIs with Go  
🐳 Learning DevOps basics (Docker, deployment, CI/CD)  
📚 Improving my technical communication in English  
-->

My interests include:
- Backend system design
- Cloud-native application architecture
- Containerization & CI/CD
- Self-hosted infrastructure as a learning playground

<!--My goal is to work remotely as a **Full-Stack Developer**, contribute to real products, and keep growing through hands-on experience. -->
